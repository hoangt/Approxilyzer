  "body": "### Overview\r\nApproxilyzer is an open-source framework for instruction level approximation and \r\nresiliency software. Approxilyzer provides a systematic way to identify \r\ninstructions that exhibit first-order approximation potential. It can also \r\nidentify silent data corruption (SDC) causing instructions in the presence of \r\nsingle-bit errors. Approxilyzer employs static and dynamic analysis, in addition \r\nto heuristics, to reduce the run-time of finding Approximate instructions and \r\nSDC-causing instructions by 3-6x orders of magnitude.\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\nPlease cite our papers when you publish results that you have obtained using \r\nApproxilyzer:\r\n\r\n1. Approxilyzer: Towards A Systematic Framework for Instruction-Level \r\nApproximate Computing and its Applications \r\n[[PDF](http://rsim.cs.uiuc.edu/Pubs/16-MICRO-approxilyzer.pdf)] \r\n\r\n2. Relyzer: exploiting application-level fault equivalence to analyze \r\napplication resiliency to transient faults \r\n[[PDF](rsim.cs.illinois.edu/Pubs/12-ASPLOS-Hari.pdf)]\r\n\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\nTo install Approxilyzer, you will need the following:\r\n\r\n1. Wisconsin Multifacet GEMS\r\n\r\n2. WindRiver Simics 3.0.31 (requires WindRiver license)\r\n\r\n3. A SPARC V9 machine running OpenSolaris \r\n\r\n4. Approxilyzer source code\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Downloading and License Agreement\r\nApproxilyzer is available at no cost with the [University of Illinois/NCSA open \r\nsource license agreement](http://rsim.cs.illinois.edu/approxilyzer/LICENSE.txt).\r\n\r\nTo install and run Approxilyzer, download the code from github, and follow the \r\ninstructions in the README.txt.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nApproxilyzer was primarily developed by [Siva Kumar Sastry \r\nHari](https://research.nvidia.com/users/siva-hari), Radha Venkatagiri, and \r\n[Abdulrahman Mahmoud](http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~amahmou2/), under the \r\ndirection of [Prof. Sarita V Adve](http://rsim.cs.illinois.edu/~sadve/) at the \r\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFor more information, see the [RSIM Group home \r\npage](http://rsim.cs.illinois.edu/).
