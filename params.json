  "body": "### Overview\r\nApproxilyzer is an open-source framework for instruction level approximation and \r\nresiliency. Approxilyzer provides a systematic way to identify \r\ninstructions that exhibit first-order approximation potential. It can also \r\nidentify silent data corruption (SDC) causing instructions in the presence of \r\nsingle-bit errors. Approxilyzer employs static and dynamic analysis, in addition \r\nto heuristics, to reduce the run-time of finding Approximate instructions and \r\nSDC-causing instructions by 3-6x orders of magnitude.\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\nPlease cite our papers when you publish results that you have obtained using \r\nApproxilyzer:\r\n\r\n1. Approxilyzer: Towards A Systematic Framework for Instruction-Level \r\nApproximate Computing and its Application to Hardware Resiliency\r\n[[PDF](http://rsim.cs.uiuc.edu/Pubs/16-MICRO-approxilyzer.pdf)] \r\n\r\n2. Relyzer: Exploiting Application-Level Fault Equivalence to Analyze Application Resiliency to Transient Faults\r\n[[PDF](http://rsim.cs.illinois.edu/Pubs/12-ASPLOS-Hari.pdf)]\r\n\r\n\r\n### Downloading and License Agreement\r\n\r\nApproxilyzer is available at no cost with the [University of Illinois/NCSA open \r\nsource license agreement](http://rsim.cs.illinois.edu/approxilyzer/LICENSE.txt). \r\n\r\nWe do request that you register here (link to come) before downloading and using the code.\r\n\r\nTo install and run Approxilyzer, download the code from github, and follow the \r\ninstructions in the README.txt.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nApproxilyzer and builds upon Relyzer as an underlying tool.
